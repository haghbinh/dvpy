## üéØ Course Goals

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the **principles of visual perception** and effective data communication.  
- Create clear, meaningful visualizations using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.  
- Design **interactive dashboards** with **Dash**.  
- Integrate visualization as part of **data analysis and storytelling workflows**.
